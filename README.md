This README will be updated.

For now the important stuff is:

1. Tikz figures should go in primitives but that is your choice.
2. All logo files are in the root directory because I was lazy. You can move them if desired.
3. The makefile should be editted so that the output file is named correctly.
The main.tex file can be changed if desired but don't forget about the makefile.
4. The rest is basic Beamer. Play and figure it out!
